      <p id="bio1">My name is Mohammed Niyaz and I’m currently a student at Northampton University studying a computing course. Before attending the University I have studied at KCA sixth form where I did a level 3 diploma course in computing/computer science. I am outgoing person and always like to stay active by participating in many sports such as football and tennis. Moreover I am interested around media and gaming from a young age and I like travelling to different places around the world. My interest for computing came around secondary school as there were so many different aspects for computing and it played a huge part in our world which made me want to get involved. This led me to do computing at GCSE to University. At the moment my pathway is undecided but for the future I am wishing to get a successful job in the computing industry which will always drive my passion and love for computers.</p> <!--my bio-->
      
      <p id="bio2">Thomas Samuels is currently a student at Northampton University, where he is studying Computer Science. Before attending Northampton University he studied at Northampton College where he did a two year Level 3 Diploma in Computer Systems Support and Networking. Since a young age Thomas has been interested in computers and video games. When Thomas isn’t gaming he often likes to spend time with his family doing a multitude of activities such as baking cakes, hiking and cycling. He first became interested in the subject of computing during his time at secondary school, he found it so captivating that he decided to study it as one of his GCSE’s and eventually as an AS Level. He is studying for a degree in computing and is currently on a general pathway that does a bit of everything. He wishes to specialise in a specific area, but currently does not know what pathway to choose. His main interest is computer networks/communication, although this preference could change. He does not know exactly what he would like to do after completing his studies at university, but he would like a career in an industry that he finds interesting and enjoyable.</p> <!--my teammate bio-->
